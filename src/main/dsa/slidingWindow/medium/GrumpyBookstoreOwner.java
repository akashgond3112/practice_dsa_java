 *          1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner
 *          Hint
 *          There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for n minutes.
 *          Every minute, some number of customers enter the store.
 *          You are given an integer array customers of length n where
 *          customers[i] is the number of the customer that enters the store at
 *          the start of the ith minute and all those customers leave after the
 *          end of that minute.
 *          <p>
 *          On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.
 *          You are given a binary array grumpy where grumpy[i] is 1 if the
 *          bookstore owner is grumpy during the ith minute, and is 0 otherwise.
 *          <p>
 *          When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are
 *          not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied.
 *          <p>
 *          The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not
 *          grumpy for minutes consecutive minutes, but can only use it once.
 *          <p>
 *          Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied
 *          throughout the day.
 *          <p>
 *          Example 1:
 *          <p>
 *          Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
 *          minutes = 3
 *          Output: 16
 *          Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the
 *          last 3 minutes.
 *          The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 +
 *          1 + 7 + 5 = 16.
 *          Example 2:
 *          <p>
 *          Input: customers = [1], grumpy = [0], minutes = 1
 *          Output: 1
