 *          1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
 *          Medium
 *          Topics
 *          Companies
 *          Hint
 *          There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an
 *          associated number of points. The points are given in the integer
 *          array cardPoints.
 *          <p>
 *          In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the
 *          end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.
 *          <p>
 *          Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.
 *          <p>
 *          Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the
 *          maximum score you can obtain.
 *          <p>
 *          Example 1:
 *          <p>
 *          Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
 *          Output: 12
 *          Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1.
 *          However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total
 *          score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right,
 *          giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
 *          Example 2:
 *          <p>
 *          Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
 *          Output: 4
 *          Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will
 *          always be 4.
 *          Example 3:
 *          <p>
 *          Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
 *          Output: 55
 *          Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum
 *          of points of all cards.
 *          <p>
 *          <p>
 *          Constraints:
 *          <p>
 *          1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5
 *          1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4
 *          1 <= k <= cardPoints.length
